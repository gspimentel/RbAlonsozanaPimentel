    I started liking K-Pop as soon as the lockdown started. At first, I felt restless at home since I was used to going out every weekend to bond with my Mommy and friends. I resorted to listening to music and watching YouTube and Netflix. One day while I was listening to music, I stumbled upon BTS’ Dynamite. It had an addictive melody and English lyrics that weren’t hard to understand, so I kept singing along to it. BTS became the first K-Pop group I ever liked. Aside from their great voices and their synchronized dances, they also had down-to-earth and hilarious personalities off-stage, which further made me a fan. Ever since then, I’ve grown to like more K-Pop groups. Some of which are Enhypen, Kep1er, and, one of the latest groups to debut, NewJeans. 
	<br><br>
	The main reason why I’ve grown to like K-Pop is because of the hidden messages portrayed in the songs. Everyone can make a hit song using different beats and instruments, but only a few artists can make songs with lyrics so meaningful that it can resonate with the hearts of listeners. An example of this is Enhypen’s Go Big Or Go Home, an electronic-pop track that delivers the inspirational message, “If you believe in yourself, you can achieve anything.”

      <h4>K-Pop is one of the two major sectors that made South Korean culture globally renowned. Some of the K-Pop groups you may know are 
          EXO, Twice, Blackpink, and BTS. But like I mentioned beforehand (See #1 for a brief introduction to K-Pop), 
          these 4 groups weren’t the ones who started the Rise of K-Pop Popularity. It all started with Seo Taiji and Boys. 
          In 1990, these artists kickstarted the K-Pop wave, and after they retired in 1992, 
          artists like Rain, H.O.T., Sechskies, and S.E.S. took their place and continued the popularity trend. That was the first generation of K-Pop. 
          The second generation consisted of TVXQ, BigBang, Girls Generation, Wonder Girls, 2NE1, and Super Junior, to name a few. 
          They helped in spreading South Korean Pop music across the globe and made it known more. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</h4></td></table> <br>

      <h4>Then came in the third generation, the batch of K-Pop idols most of you may be familiar with. The idols from this generation are 
          EXO, Seventeen, Twice, Itzy, Blackpink, and BTS among many others. BTS is the most iconic group of this generation, and may arguably be 
          the best K-Pop group yet! This may be because they were the first group that really penetrated the US market, and along with their 
          great chemistry and synergy, they were able to maintain and cement their popularity and status worldwide. As for the fourth generation, 
          the newest generation of K-Pop, this would consist of idols like ENHYPEN, Kep1er, NewJeans, etc. 
          In a nutshell, 1990 was the year when K-Pop was formally introduced. We are now on the fourth generation of this musical phenomenon, 
          and so far it shows no sign of stopping any time soon. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</h4></td></table><br>

  <h2>K-Pop</h2>

      <h4>K-Pop is one of the two major sectors that made South Korean culture globally renowned. Some of the K-Pop groups you may know are EXO, Twice, Blackpink, and BTS. But like I mentioned beforehand (See #1 for a brief introduction to K-Pop), these 4 groups weren’t the ones who started the Rise of K-Pop Popularity. It all started with Seo Taiji and Boys. In 1990, these artists kickstarted the K-Pop wave, and after they retired in 1992, artists like Rain, H.O.T., Sechskies, and S.E.S. took their place and continued the popularity trend. That was the first generation of K-Pop. The second generation consisted of TVXQ, BigBang, Girls Generation, Wonder Girls, 2NE1, and Super Junior, to name a few. They helped in spreading South Korean Pop music across the globe and made it known more. </h4></td></table> <br>

      <h4>Then came in the third generation, the batch of K-Pop idols most of you may be familiar with. The idols from this generation are EXO, Seventeen, Twice, Itzy, Blackpink, and BTS among many others. BTS is the most iconic group of this generation, and may arguably be the best K-Pop group yet! This may be because they were the first group that really penetrated the US market, and along with their great chemistry and synergy, they were able to maintain and cement their popularity and status worldwide. As for the fourth generation, the newest generation of K-Pop, this would consist of idols like ENHYPEN, Kep1er, NewJeans, etc. In a nutshell, 1990 was the year when K-Pop was formally introduced. We are now on the fourth generation of this musical phenomenon, and so far it shows no sign of stopping any time soon.</h4></td></table><br>

  <h2>K-Dramas</h2>

      <h4>The other sector which made a major contribution to spreading the word about Korean Culture across the globe are the Korean Television Dramas, more popularly known and called as “K-Dramas”. The first TV series was broadcasted in 1962 via KBS (Korean Broadcasting System). But unlike K-Pop’s story to stardom, K-Dramas’ rise in popularity wasn’t as fast as that of the K-Pop’s progress. In fact, it took years for the dramas to gain popularity and fans from all over the world. Nevertheless, K-Dramas have managed to establish its sector as an important promoter of Korean Culture.</h4></td></table><br> <br><br>

      <h4>But not all K-Dramas were able to make a mark in the competitive drama world, which is why K-Dramas try to follow a simple formula to make its plot captivating and across the world. <br>
- K-Drama plots should have a mixture of predictability and twists<br>
- Include Korean norms to make drama realistic<br>
- Actors and Actresses should be a match for the roles of the K-Drama<br>
- Film the first 4 episodes before releasing the drama to the public<br>
- Determine success and viewership progress:<br><br>
- Not successful:<br>
- Tweak the plot to make it more interesting<br><br>
- Successful:<br>
- Extend the number of episodes<br>
This tried-and-tested formula has proven itself to be a viable asset for Korean producers, which is why they are able to make famous K-Dramas such as Squid Game, Crash Landing On You, and Itaewon Class among many others.</h4></td></table>

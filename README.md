# RbAlonsozanaPimentel Topic Proposal
Topic: Hallyu Wave 

Title: Highlighting Hallyu

The website we'll be creating will revolve around the hallyu wave. It's going to be an informative site about hallyu, its history and we'll also be comparing an aspect of it to one of ours (a Philippine counterpart). Korean culture has been very famous these past years, and as one of the people who enjoy it ourselves, we'd like to share about it especially to people who don't know of it much. 

For the layout of the website, it will have the title, the creators' names (our names), and 5 links to the five other webpages that will discuss some subtopics. 

*All 5 webpages will have some images, the text discussing the subtopic and 5 links: one back to the home page 4 other links to the 4 other webpages.*
